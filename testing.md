# c-ssg

A *very opinionated* and minimal static site generator written in C.

> My website is built using `c-ssg`. Check it out [here](https://norsomething.github.io)!

`c-ssg` takes a directory of Markdown files and generates a complete static website with a shared navigation bar, nested sections, and plain HTML output. It is super lightweight and built using standard POSIX interfaces.

## How it Works

Every Markdown file placed directly inside `markdowns/` becomes its own page.

For example,

```
markdowns/
├── index.md
├── about.md
└── contact.md
```

generates

```
Home | About | Contact
```

in the navigation bar.

Folders inside `markdowns/` become navigation entries themselves.

For example,

```
markdowns/
├── index.md
└── guides/
    ├── installation.md
    ├── configuration.md
    └── deployment.md
```

generates a navigation bar like

```
Home | Guides
```

Clicking **Guides** opens a page containing links to

- Installation
- Configuration
- Deployment

Each Markdown file inside the folder is also converted into its own HTML page.

### Images
To insert images into any of the websites, you will have to store the image in the `site-imgs` directory with a unique name and insert the image in the markdown file in the following format : 
```
~img=<image name>~
```
For example, to insert an image of a cat, file name being `cat.png`, edit the markdown file to contain:
```
~img=cat.png
```
Save the `cat.png` file in the `site-imgs` directory.

### Videos
Videos insertion follow the same syntax as images.
```
~vid=cat.mp4~
```
Save the `cat.mp4` file in the `site-imgs` directory as well.

### Frontmatter and footer links

Each Markdown page may start with frontmatter. The parser splits each entry at its first `:`, so URLs such as `https://...` are preserved in full.

```
---
title: My page title
tags: <tag1>, <tag2>, <tag3>
GitHub: https://github.com/<username>
Resume: https://example.com/resume.pdf
My blog: https://example.com/blog
---
Your markdown content
```

`title` sets the HTML page title and `tags` adds page tags. Every other frontmatter entry becomes a bottom-bar link: the key is its visible label and the value is used unchanged as the anchor's `href`.

For example, `My blog: https://example.com/blog` renders as `<a href="https://example.com/blog">My blog</a>`. Add, edit, or remove these entries to customize that page's bottom bar.

More syntax is planned.

---

## Building

Build using the included makefile.

```bash
make
```

Run the generator:

```bash
./c-ssg
```

Generated files will appear inside `htmlfiles/`.

---

## Customization

The generated pages all share the same stylesheet.

```
cssfiles/styles.css
```

Editing this file changes the appearance of the entire website.
